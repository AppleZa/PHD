amount of climate-relevant time series data. To interactively explore and analyze such high-dimensionaldatasets, we developed the software OceanTEA. Our open-source tool leverages modern web technology to support interactive data visualization, spatial analysis of current patterns, and temporal pattern discovery via machine learning methods. The microservice architecture of OceanTEA ensures a maintainable implementation that seamlessly scales from desktop computers to cloud computing infrastructure.},
